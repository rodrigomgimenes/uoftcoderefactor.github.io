# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor


## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Review

Based on an existing code, the following changes were made:

* New Webpage Title;
* Addition of Viewport element in HTML;
* Addition of Bootstrap;
* Addition of Navbar instead of a Div;
* Replacement of Divs for Sections;
* Addition of Alt attibutes in all images;
* Usage of Grid concept (container, rows, columns);
* Addition of Footer element;
* Addition of a Javascript function for a Responsive Menu;
* Addition of Media Query to create a Responsive Website in CSS; and
* Addition of comments along the code (so it makes easier future alterations).
